Allows you to copy images from Reddit posts to your clipboard. The offical Reddit mobile application does not support copying images to clipboard, instead, if users want to share a image from a post, they would have to download the image to their device's gallery. 

Once the image is saved to your clipboard, you can paste the image wherever you like

Once the image is saved, you can paste it just like any other image/text. For example, we can see here that I have the option to paste this image on WhatsApp
